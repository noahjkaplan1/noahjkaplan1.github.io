            <p>I'm an experienced scientist and team leader in the agricultural biotechnology space. I have a passion for building systems and teams that empower organizations to deliver high-impact results. My background spans molecular biology, plant genetics, data management, regulatory affairs, and operational leadership, and I have a growing focus on the implementation of new technologies. I've led teams, built labs from the ground up, and supported early-stage startups in navigating complex technical and logistical landscapes. I'm currently exploring new opportunities to apply my expertise toward mission-driven projects and entrepreneurial ventures.</p>
